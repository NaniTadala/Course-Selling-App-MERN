COURSE SELLING APP
This project consists of three main folders: client-user, client-admin, and server.

Client-User
The client-user folder contains the user-facing client application, built using Vite and React. This part of the project focuses on the user interface and functionality accessible to regular users. To get started with the client-user application, follow these steps:

Navigate to the client-user directory: cd client-user.
Install dependencies: npm install.
Start the development server: npm run dev.
The above steps will launch the client-user application in development mode. You can access it in your web browser at http://localhost:5173.

Client-Admin
The client-admin folder contains the admin-facing client application, also built using Vite and React. This part of the project is dedicated to administrative tasks and features. To get started with the client-admin application, follow similar steps as with the client-user application:

Navigate to the client-admin directory: cd client-admin.
Install dependencies: npm install.
Start the development server: npm run dev.
The client-admin application will be accessible in your web browser at http://localhost:5173.

Server
The server folder houses the server-side component of the project, built using Node.js and Express. This part of the project handles data processing, business logic, and communication between clients and the server. To set up and run the server, follow these steps:

Navigate to the server directory: cd server.
Install dependencies: npm install.
Start the server: node server.js.
The server will start running and will be accessible at the specified port (usually http://localhost:3000).
